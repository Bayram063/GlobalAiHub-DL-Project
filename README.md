 GlobalAiHub DL Project - Urban Sounds Classification

Prepared by: Zeynep Koyun - Caner Tiryaki - Bayram Kaya

In this project, we made a project on the classification of sounds heard in cities using the “UrbanSounds8K” dataset.
Our goal in this project is to prepare an artificial intelligence model using deep learning algorithms.
We will prepare and train the CNN model by preprocessing the images in the spectrogram.
